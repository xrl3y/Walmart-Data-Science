# Walmart-Data-Science
This project analyzes Walmart's sales data across 45 stores, examining how external conditions such as unemployment rates, inflation, and temperature impact sales trends. Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve forecasting and strategic planning for Walmartâ€™s retail operations.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Sales data** from 45 Walmart stores
- **External conditions**: Unemployment rates, inflation indices, and temperature records
- **Time span**: Monthly data, capturing seasonal trends and economic fluctuations

The dataset is available in:
- **Excel format** for data modeling, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI format** for interactive data exploration.

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Power BI**: For dynamic visualization and report generation
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data modeling and pre-processing
- **Python (optional)**: For further data cleaning or advanced analysis if required

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Dataset**: Clone this repository and download the Excel file from the `data` folder.
2. **Open in Power BI**: Import the Excel file into Power BI to explore the pre-built data models and create interactive visualizations.
